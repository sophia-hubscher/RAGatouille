    "question": "How does ISO look at  the potential impact of wind conditions on transmission line ratings",
    "answer": "ISO New England assesses the potential impact of wind conditions on transmission line ratings by considering the uniqueness of the New England geographic and operational environment. They note that incorporating wind speed and direction into line ratings may lead to increased uncertainty rather than clear benefits due to the region's low levels of thermal congestion. ",
    "ground_truth": "In the ANOPR, the Commission preliminarily proposes to require certain transmission lines to reflect up-to-date forecasts of wind conditions, including wind speed and direction for use in 48-hour transmission service.This would be required only for transmission lines that exceed certain thresholds for wind speed. For transmission lines subject to this requirement, Transmission Providers must use transmission line ratings that account for wind speed and direction for hourly and daily point-to-point transmission services under the pro forma OATT that fall within a 48-hour time horizon.",
    "generated_answer": "ISO looks at the potential impact of wind conditions on transmission line ratings by incorporating wind velocity as one of the key environmental factors in the thermal rating calculations for transmission equipment. The ratings are based on estimates and approximations of environmental conditions, with wind velocity being influential alongside ambient temperature. The historical approach in New England has involved determining benchmark environmental conditions, which include wind velocities, to calculate seasonal ratings for different types of equipment. This ensures that the ratings reflect the actual conditions that can affect the thermal performance and safety of the transmission lines.",

      "It must be recognized that at any given moment temperature and wind conditions will almost \n\ncertainly be different from the above; therefore, the use of rating based on the above must be \n\nclearly defined.  It is the Task Force’s understanding that ratings arrived at by application of \n\nthese procedures and parameters will be used as alarm points in the system dispatch computers.  \n\nIt is further understood that on receiving and alarm for a particular line, the satellite dispatcher \n\nmay either contact the operating company or companies involved and ask for a revised rating \n\nbased on atmospheric conditions existing at the time of the required emergency loading or \n\nconsult data supplied to him by the operating companies. \n\nIf a company chooses to apply probability calculations and use different atmospheric parameters, \n\nit is likely that the alarm point ratings will be the actual ratings to be used to limit line loadings \n\nirrespective of ambient conditions at the time. \n\n\n\nCorrected October 2004 \n\n71 \n\n11.2 Recommendations \n\nBearing in mind that the recommendations are guidelines, the following proposals are presented: \n\n1. Normal and Long-Time Emergency conductor ratings should be obtained by use \n\nof New England Electric System Computer Program PG92 titled “Current \n\nCarrying Capacity of Overhead Conductors.” \n\n2. Drastic Action Limit and Short-Time Emergency rating (15 minute) may be found \n\nusing the NEES Computer Program PG108, “Transient Overhead Conductor \n\nTemperature Calculations.”  Seventy-five percent of the clearance limited circuit \n\nrating will be assumed as the pre-disturbance loading for the calculation of the \n\nDrastic Action Limit. \n\n3. Input parameters for conductor diameter, wind velocity, emissivity factor, \n\nambient temperature, and conductor resistance should be as specified or obtained \n\nby methods specified herein. \n\n4. Equation constants used in the rating program should be as specified herein.",

DLRs hold potential to cost effectively and quickly expand the \ncapability of the transmission grid using existing rights-of-way. However, deployment of DLRs is not \nstraightforward, and a number of implementation issues must also be addressed to reap their full potential. \nTransmission capability may be limited by elements of the system, such as breakers, switches, and bus \nconductors, as well as by the line’s conductor (i.e., wire in the air). In other cases, stability considerations \nmay limit facility ratings. In instances like these, DLR deployment may not effectively increase transmission \ncapability.  In all cases, the communications channels used to enable DLRs must be cyber secure, and grid \noperators must have real-time awareness of DLR deployment on their systems as well as those of their \nneighboring systems to accurately model power flows across the grid. DLRs on tie lines must be \nappropriately coordinated among impacted Transmission Owners (TO), Transmission Operators (TOP), and \nReliability Coordinators (RC). \n \nReliability Benefits and Critical Issues \nThe maximum amount of power that can safely flow on a line is limited by physical properties, like \nconductor heating and sagging limitations, and a variety of substation equipment ratings. DLR equipment \nand software calculate real-time transmission line capacity based on current weather conditions, such as \nambient and conductor temperatures, wind speeds, and solar irradiation. Unlike static line ratings, which \ntypically assume conservative seasonal worst-case conditions, application of DLRs result in real-time",

These are combined to calculate seasonal ratings for the different types of \nequipment.  These factors, including the “benchmark” ambient temperatures and wind \nvelocities, were initially established in 1971 with NEPOOL’s adoption of the Capacity Ratings \nProcedures.

Any change to a GSU transformer tap \nsetting could be considered a material change to the system and would be processed \nthrough the ISO‐NE planning process in accordance with Section I.3.9 of the ISO‐NE Tariff. \nIn accordance with ISO‐NE Planning Procedure 5‐1, “Procedure for Review of Market \nParticipant’s or Transmission Owner’s Proposed Plans (Section I.3.9 Applications: \nRequirements, Procedures and Forms)” (Section 2.2 Transmission Changes), “All \ntransmission changes that change the topology or characteristics of the transmission \nsystem or that change the thermal capability of a portion of the system by replacement \nof transmission facilities…require a Proposed Plan Application (PPA)” under Section I.3.9 \nof the ISO‐NE Tariff. This requirement applies to Generator Asset leads and associated \nequipment, such as GSU transformers.  \n \n\nISO‐NE does not specifically review and request GSU transformer tap changes for \n\nvoltage/reactive control in Real‐Time. Generator Assets are required to maintain a \n\nspecified voltage schedule within a tolerance band. If ISO‐NE or an LCC identifies a",
      "requires governor model validation from any nuclear power \nstation that provides under‐frequency response and allows exemptions for those that do \nnot.  \n\n  \n\nIn New England, ISO‐NE has determined that the reliability need regarding Generator \nAsset real power response to system frequency variations pertains only to under‐\nfrequency excursion events (and not over‐frequency excursion events). Accordingly, ISO‐\nNE allows Generator Assets that are only capable of responding to over‐frequency (and \nnot capable of responding to under‐frequency) to obtain the same exemption from the \nMOD‐027‐1 R2 model verification Requirements that the Standard allows for Generator \nAssets that are not responsive to both over‐ and under‐frequency excursion events.  \n\n  \n\nAccording to MOD‐027 Attachment 1, Row Number 7, Verification Condition: “Applicable \n\nunit is not responsive to both over and under frequency excursion events (The applicable \n\nunit does not operate in a frequency control mode, except during normal start up and \n\nshut down, that would result in a turbine/governor and load control or active \n\npower/frequency control mode response.);  \n\nOR  \n\nApplicable unit either does not have an installed frequency control system or has a \ndisabled frequency control system.”   \nThen, according to MOD‐027 Attachment 1, Row 7, Required Action: “Requirement R2 is \nmet with a written statement to that effect transmitted to the Transmission Planner.”  \n\n  \n\nAs mentioned above, ISO‐NE has no reliability need for governor model validation from \nnuclear power stations that do not provide under‐frequency response (even if they do \nprovide over‐frequency response). Therefore, In New England, nuclear power stations \nmay meet Requirement R2 by providing a written statement to ISO‐NE, as applicable, \nstating that the nuclear power station is either:  \n\n• not responsive to both over‐ and under‐frequency excursion events; or  \n\n• not responsive to under‐frequency excursion events.",

      "our daily lives. \n \nManaging the real-time reliability of the system requires control room operators to possess increasing levels of \ncognition, attention, vigilance, knowledge, and abstract reasoning, invariably leading many to consider new AI/ML \nsolutions. Because the BPS is the planet’s most complex sociotechnical system (a system involving complex humans \nand complex systems with complex interactions between them), many considerations are needed to minimize the \nrisks to the system. \n \nThis document is intended for decisionmakers, regulators, and end users of these technologies, particularly in real-\ntime operations. It is not helpful to assert whether these technologies should be used in real-time operations, as \nsurveys and interviews of key stakeholders throughout the industry show that this is already happening. The “genie” \ncannot be put back in the bottle (and this document does not assert that it should). Instead, this document provides \nguidance on the kinds of questions that one should ask about these technologies to thoroughly understand what they \nare capable of and what kinds of changes are needed to implement them properly. \n \nPrevious technologies to come to market have fallen into typical patterns, leading to initial “bumpy” implementations \nwith unexpected risks or adverse events. This document offers a path for real-time operations—in which such adverse \nevents are intolerable—in an attempt to ensure that AI/ML technologies can be implemented in a way that maximizes \nthe chances of a successful, reliability-enhancing deployment. \n \nThere is strong recognition that many organizations across the industry are already considering AI/ML applications \nand making a variety of decisions from actively trying to avoid them (e.g., blocking Generative Pre-trained \nTransformer (GPT) access from work computers and enacting policies about information security) to embracing them",
      "In such a case, this can unintentionally expose the utility to liability. \n \nFor a system operator using a generative tool to generate reports, concerns about these kinds of risks may lead the \noperator to focus on certain concerns (e.g., rephrasing certain text) and shift their focus away from other concerns \n(e.g., ensuring that a conclusion is valid). \n \nInformational Leakage \nDuring informal interviews and in survey results, significant concerns were raised around ensuring the security of \nprivate or confidential information, especially around Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), whether being \nsent to or returned by generative AI systems. Already, operators who write reports have to consider what information \nto include or exclude based on reporting and confidentiality requirements. Leveraging generative AI to write these \nkinds of reports may lead to occasional inclusion of information that an operator would not have wanted in the \ndocument. Depending on how the generative AI was trained, for example, it may be unable to distinguish between \ntwo different report types, one that must include certain CEII and another that must not. \n \nAllocation of Risk \nAcross many domains where AI/ML is being used, there are significant legal concerns around the allocation of risk. \nAutonomous vehicle systems are a strong example of this, as the courts have not yet determined what happens when \nan autonomous vehicle makes a decision that leads to an accident or a violation of the law. Similarly, as real-time \noperations look at a wide range of use cases for AI/ML technologies to replace and/or supplement human decision \nmaking, there may be questions about what happens when the technology provides an incorrect answer.  \n \nFor example, when a technology that uses AI/ML to perform load forecasting (e.g., “similar day” analysis) picks \nincorrectly and leads to significant under-commitment of generation, what occurs next? If the operator was unable",

The task was a challenge when \nforecasting the electric demand was the biggest uncertainty, but there are now increased uncertainties that arise \nwhen forecasts for solar and wind generation must also be considered when it comes to ensuring that the accurate \nbalance of generation to load will be maintained. Further complicating this are the behind-the-meter installations of \nsolar and other distributed resources whose output is affected by both weather conditions and other human factors.  \n \nThe current state of the art is for grid operators to use existing ML and weather models to develop forecasts for load, \nas noted above, and layer on top the forecasts for wind and solar to develop a “net load” for which traditional \ngeneration will need to be dispatched to follow. In addition to the challenge of forecasting each of these three major \ncomponents of uncertainty accurately, there are challenges in predicting the range of errors inherent to each forecast \nto then informing the operating plan for how many MWs to prepare to dispatch and how many MWs may need to \nbe held in reserve.

For \nexample, a system operator who distrusts data flowing from a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) will significantly change \nthe operator’s speed, steps, and decisions on the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. In the \nsame way, an operator who is given recommendations from an AI/ML system, or who reviews generated text that \nappears to be incorrect, will not only change behavior in that moment but also likely in the near future until that \nconfidence is restored.  \n \nAs an example, users’ ability to see a visualization of how input data is transformed in an AI/ML system improved \ntheir perception of the system’s reliability (Kerr, et al., 2007). However, automation bias (Mosier & Skitka, 1999) \nmakes people more likely to assume the correctness of a machine’s output rather than a human’s. Overcoming these \nand several other biases and patterns to target a consistent “trust but verify” approach to reviewing and taking action \non AI/ML data is necessary for a successful outcome.",

Reactive Resources \nmay recover their variable Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC), Cost of Energy Consumed (CEC) and Cost of \nEnergy Produced (CEP) costs pursuant to Schedule 2. \n \nIn addition, a Reactive Resource that qualifies as a Qualified Reactive Resource (QRR) may receive \nCC compensation and be included in the Capacity Cost compensation program (CCCP). The QRR may \ncontinue to receive CC compensation as long as it continues to meet the qualification requirements, \nincluding performing periodic auditing of its reactive capability, of Schedule 2. \n \nAll QRRs are subject to the requirements of this Business Procedure. Where necessary, this Business \nProcedure describes specific requirements for each type of Reactive Resource to be designated as a \nQRR and to receive CC compensation.   \n \n\n1.3 Applicability \nThis Business Procedure is applicable to the following: (1) all Transmission Customers under the \nTariff; (2) all entities owning or controlling the reactive power capability of Reactive Resources \n(Reactive Resource Providers) within the New England Control Area that are under the ISO’s \noperational control and that are eligible to receive CC compensation; (3) the LCCs; and (4) the ISO. \n \n\n2.0 Responsibilities \n \n2.1 Reactive Resource Provider"
