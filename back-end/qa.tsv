ISO New England assesses the potential impact of wind conditions on transmission line ratings by considering the uniqueness of the New England geographic and operational environment. They note that incorporating wind speed and direction into line ratings may lead to increased uncertainty rather than clear benefits due to the region's low levels of thermal congestion. 	How does ISO look at  the potential impact of wind conditions on transmission line ratings	In the ANOPR, the Commission preliminarily proposes to require certain transmission lines to reflect up-to-date forecasts of wind conditions, including wind speed and direction for use in 48-hour transmission service.This would be required only for transmission lines that exceed certain thresholds for wind speed. For transmission lines subject to this requirement, Transmission Providers must use transmission line ratings that account for wind speed and direction for hourly and daily point-to-point transmission services under the pro forma OATT that fall within a 48-hour time horizon.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/100016/rm24-6_iso-ne_dlr_anopr_comments.pdf
ISO proposes that changes in line rating methodologies, particularly the incorporation of wind speed and direction, should only be considered when congestion levels exceed a sufficiently high threshold.	What metrics does ISO look at in line rating methodologies?	These would include: “requiring transmission line ratings to reflect solar heating based on the sun’s position and forecastable cloud cover; [and] requiring transmission line ratings to reflect forecasts of wind conditions – wind speed and wind direction – on certain transmission lines.”	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/100016/rm24-6_iso-ne_dlr_anopr_comments.pdf
Through or Out Service allows Market Participants to export energy to adjacent control areas and settle these transactions in the Real-Time Energy Market based on deviations from Day-Ahead activities.	What is the purpose of Through or Out Service?	2.4.1 Through or Out Transmission Service Accounting This section of the manual describes the Through or Out Service accounting treatment in the Real-Time Energy Market. 2.4.1.1 OUT SERVICE A Market Participant can utilize Through or Out Service to export energy at external nodes to control areas adjacent to the New England Control Area. The service is established by the submittal and subsequent scheduling of a Real-Time export transaction at an external node, which creates a load obligation at that location. The transaction is settled in the Real-Time Energy Market as the deviation of from Day-Ahead activity at the node, multiplied by the components of the Real-Time LMP at the node. 2.4.1.2 THROUGH SERVICE A Transmission Customer can utilize Through or Out Service in the Real-Time Energy Market to wheel energy from one external node to another external node of the New England Control Area. The service is established by the submittal and subsequent scheduling of a Real-Time external transaction which identifies two external nodes. The transaction creates a generation obligation at the importing external node, and a load obligation at the exporting external node. The transaction is settled in the Real-Time Market as the deviation from Day-Ahead activity at each location. As there is no Through Service in the Day-Ahead Market, the settlement of this type of transaction in Real-Time effectively becomes the difference between the Real-Time congestion and loss components at the two external nodes. (The difference in the energy component settlement always nets to zero, since the energy components of the LMP are uniform at all pricing locations.)	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/trans/services/types_apps/rns_tout_srvc_agrmnt_app.docx
The two types are Internal Bilateral for Market for Energy and Internal Bilateral for Load, which are settled by the ISO for the Energy Market.	What are the two types of Bilateral Transactions?	There are two types of Internal Bilateral Transactions that Market Participants may enter into that are settled by the ISO for the Energy Market: Internal Bilateral for Market for Energy and Internal Bilateral for Load. Bilateral transactions are not part of the Day-Ahead clearing process or Real-Time dispatch; however, an Internal Bilateral Transaction submitted to the ISO is a physical transfer of an energy obligation.Please see the user guide for Submitting Internal Bilateral Transactions Using SMS for descriptions of the features of each type of Internal Bilateral Transaction and the mechanics of their submittal to the ISO. All such transactions must be submitted and confirmed in advance of the appropriate deadline, defined as the Day-Ahead Internal Bilateral Transaction Trading Deadline and Real-Time Internal Bilateral Transaction Trading Deadline.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/trans/services/types_apps/rns_tout_srvc_agrmnt_app.docx
The ISO must provide loss data by 0800 of the next Business Day; failure to do so delays the Host Participant's daily settlement data submission by one hour for each hour of delay, up to a maximum of 1700 three Business Days after the Operating Day.	What is the deadline for the ISO to provide loss data for settlement?	By 0800 of the next Business Day following the Operating Day, the ISO provides loss data for which it is the Assigned Meter Reader to the appropriate Market Participants. If the ISO fails to provide this data by the time frame indicated, the deadline for Host Participant daily settlement data submission will be delayed by one hour for each hour that the data is delayed but in no case will the deadline for Host Participant daily settlement data submission be extended beyond the beginning of hour 1700 three Business Days after the Operating Day.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/trans/services/types_apps/rns_tout_srvc_agrmnt_app.docx

Think of financial assurance allocation like filling up multiple buckets in a specific order. First, we make sure your Market Credit Test bucket isn't overflowing (stays at or below 100%). Then we do the same for your FTR Credit Test and Transmission Credit Test buckets. Once those are taken care of, we go back and try to keep all buckets below 90%, then below 80%. If there's anything left over after all that, it goes back to support your Market Credit Test.	How does financial assurance allocation work?	Market Participant's financial assurance is allocated in the following order:  1. First, to ensure the Market Credit Test Percentage is no greater than 100% 2. Then, to ensure the FTR Credit Test Percentage is no greater than 100% 3. Next, to ensure the Transmission Credit Test Percentage is no greater than 100% 4. If any remains, the process is repeated to ensure these percentages are no greater than 89.99% 5. If there's still a remainder, the process is again repeated to ensure the percentages are no greater than 79.99% 6. Any remaining financial assurance is allocated to the Market Credit Test Percentage.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
The initial requirement is calculated using a straightforward formula: FAR = G + T + L + E  G: Your generation capacity T: How many MWs you plan to trade L: Your Real-Time Load Obligation E: Your expected share of monthly Participant Expenses  You'll need to have this ready one business day before you start any market activity.	What is the Initial Market Participant Financial Assurance Requirement for new and returning Market Participants?	The Initial Market Participant Financial Assurance Requirement is calculated using the formula FAR = G + T + L + E, where G represents generation capacity, T represents MWs to be traded, L represents Real-Time Load Obligation, and E represents the average monthly share of Participant Expenses. This amount must be provided to the ISO no later than one Business Day before commencing activity in the New England Markets or transmission service under the Tariff.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
It depends on your status:  New participants: 3 months Returning participants (those who previously defaulted): 6 months	How long are new and returning Market Participants subject to the Initial Market Participant Financial Assurance Requirement?	New Market Participants are required to provide this financial assurance for three months, while Returning Market Participants (those whose previous membership was involuntarily terminated due to a Financial Assurance Default or payment default) must provide it for six months.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
There are three important thresholds to watch:  At 80%: First warning level - triggers specific market restrictions At 90%: Second warning level - additional restrictions kick in Above 100%: Highest risk level - most severe restrictions apply	What happens if a new or returning Market Participant's Initial Market Participant Financial Assurance Requirement reaches certain thresholds of their provided financial assurance?	If the requirement reaches:  - 80% or more of the available financial assurance, it has the same effect as if the Market Participant's Market Credit Test Percentage, FTR Credit Test Percentage, or Transmission Credit Test Percentage equaled or exceeded 80%. - 90% or more, it has the same effect as if those percentages equaled or exceeded 90%. - Over 100%, it has the same effect as if those percentages exceeded 100%. These thresholds trigger the same consequences as outlined in Section III.B of the policy.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
This is a specific requirement for FCM participants, calculated using a complex formula that considers several factors:  Delivery financial assurance MW Potential exposure Average balancing ratio Performance metrics Scaling factors Various collateral and charge adjustments	What is FCM Delivery Financial Assurance and how is it calculated?	FCM Delivery Financial Assurance is a component of the FCM Financial Assurance Requirements for Designated FCM Participants. It is calculated using the formula: FCM Delivery Financial Assurance = [DFAMW x PE x max[(ABR – CWAP), 0.1] x SF] – IMC – MCC, where DFAMW is delivery financial assurance MW, PE is potential exposure, ABR is average balancing ratio, CWAP is capacity weighted average performance, SF is a scaling factor, IMC is intra-month collateral, and MCC is monthly capacity charge.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
For auctions starting with the ninth Forward Capacity Auction, you'll need to put up financial assurance equal to the difference between: Net CONE (adjusted) × Your qualified Non-Commercial Capacity Your FCM Deposit This gets recalculated after the auction based on what capacity obligation you actually received and the clearing price.	What are the financial assurance requirements for Non-Commercial Capacity participating in Forward Capacity Auctions?	For Non-Commercial Capacity participating in the ninth Forward Capacity Auction and later, a Designated FCM Participant must include in their FCM Financial Assurance Requirements an amount equal to the difference between the Net CONE associated with the auction (adjusted) times the Non-Commercial Capacity qualified, and the FCM Deposit. This amount is recalculated after the auction using a formula that includes factors such as the Capacity Supply Obligation awarded and the Capacity Clearing Price.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
If your capacity isn't commercial when it's supposed to be, the financial requirements get progressively tougher: Starting month 2: The multiplier jumps to 4× Every 6 months after that: The multiplier increases by 1 This continues until either the capacity becomes commercial or your obligation is terminated.	How is the Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount adjusted if the capacity fails to become commercial?	If Non-Commercial Capacity fails to become commercial by the start of its Capacity Commitment Period, the Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount is recalculated. Beginning on the first Business Day of the second month of the Capacity Commitment Period, the Multiplier in the calculation increases to four. It then increases by one every six months until the capacity becomes commercial or the Capacity Supply Obligation is terminated.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
If you default on Non-Commercial Capacity obligations: Daily penalty: 1% of your total Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount If not fixed quickly: You could lose your Capacity Supply Obligations Additional consequences: Can't get new obligations, lose your FCM Deposit and Financial Assurance Amount Worst case: You might get billed for any remaining shortfall	What happens if a Designated FCM Participant defaults on its financial assurance obligations related to Non-Commercial Capacity?	If a Designated FCM Participant defaults and doesn't cure within the appropriate period, they will be assessed a daily default charge of 1% of their total Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount. If the default isn't cured within the Non-Commercial Capacity Cure Period, consequences include termination of Capacity Supply Obligations, preclusion from acquiring new obligations, draw down of their FCM Deposit and Non-Commercial Capacity Financial Assurance Amount, and possible invoicing for any shortfall.	https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/09/sect_i_ex_ia.pdf
